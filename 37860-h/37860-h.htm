<I>DEDICATION</I><BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Lord, I have seen at harvest festival<BR>
In a white lamp-lit fishing-village church,<BR>
How the poor folk, lacking fine decorations,<BR>
Offer the first-fruits of their various toils:<BR>
Not only fruit and blossom of the fields,<BR>
Ripe corn and poppies, scabious, marguerites,<BR>
Melons and marrows, carrots and potatoes,<BR>
And pale round turnips and sweet cottage flowers,<BR>
But gifts of other produce, heaped brown nets,<BR>
Fine pollack, silver fish with umber backs,<BR>
And handsome green-dark-blue-striped mackerel,<BR>
And uglier, hornier creatures from the sea,<BR>
Lobsters, long-clawed and eyed, and smooth flat crabs,<BR>
Ranged with the flowers upon the window-niches,<BR>
To lie in that symbolic contiguity<BR>
While lusty hymns of gratitude ascend.</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>So I<BR>
Here offer all I have found:<BR>
A few bright stainless flowers<BR>
And richer, earthlier blooms, and homely grain,<BR>
And roots that grew distorted in the dark,<BR>
And shapes of livid hue and sprawling form<BR>
Dragged from the deepest maters I have searched.<BR>
Most diverse gifts, yet all alike in this:<BR>
They are all the natural products of my mind<BR>
And heart and senses;<BR>
And all with labour grown, or plucked, or caught.</I><BR>

PREFACE
</H3>

<P>
The title of this book was chosen for this reason.  Had the volume been
called &mdash;&mdash; <I>and Other Poems</I> it might have given a false impression
that its contents were entirely new.  Had it been called <I>Collected
Poems</I> the equally false impression might have been given that there
was something of finality about it.  The title selected seemed best to
convey both the fact that it was a collection and that, under
Providence, other (and, let us hope, superior) collections will follow
it.
</P>

<P>
The book contains all that I do not wish to destroy of the contents of
four volumes of verse.  A number of small corrections have been made.
There are added, also, a few recent poems not previously published.
The earliest of the poems now reprinted is dated 1905, in which year I
was twenty-one.  Some of the subsequent years, such as 1914 and 1915,
contributed nothing to this book: the greater number of the poems were
written in 1911-1912 and 1916-1917.
</P>

<P>
Some of the poems were not written as I should now write them; and many
of them reflect transient, though mostly recurrent, moods which I do
not necessarily think worthy of esteem.

  IN A CHAIR
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
The room is full of the peace of night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small flames murmur and flicker and sway,<BR>
Within me is neither shadow, nor light,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor night, nor twilight, nor dawn, nor day.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For the brain strives not to the goal of thought,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the limbs lie wearied, and all desire<BR>
Sleeps for a while, and I am naught<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a pair of eyes that gaze at a fire.<BR>

A DAY<BR>

I. MORNING<BR>
</H4>

<P CLASS="poem">
The village fades away<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I last night came,<BR>
Where they housed me and fed me<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never asked my name.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The sun shines bright, my step is light,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, who have no abode,<BR>
Jeer at the stuck, monotonous<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black posts along the road.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
II. MIDDAY<BR>
</H4>

<P CLASS="poem">
The wood is still,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As here I sit<BR>
My heart drinks in<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peace of it.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A something stirs<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not where,<BR>
Some quiet spirit<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
O tall straight stems!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O cool deep green!<BR>
O hand unfelt!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O face unseen!<BR>

III. EVENING<BR>
</H4>

<P CLASS="poem">
The evening closes in,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As down this last long lane<BR>
I plod; there patter round<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First heavy drops of rain.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Feet ache, legs ache, but now<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step quickens as I think<BR>
Of mounds of bread and cheese<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And something hot to drink.<BR>

IV. NIGHT<BR>
</H4>

<P CLASS="poem">
Ah! sleep is sweet, but yet<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not sleep awhile<BR>
Nor for a space forget<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toil of that last mile;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But lie awake and feel<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cool sheets' tremulous kisses<BR>
O'er all my body steal...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is sleep as sweet as this is?<BR>

THE ROOF<BR>
</H3>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
I<BR>
</H4>

<P CLASS="poem">
When the clouds hide the sun away<BR>
The tall slate roof is dull and grey,<BR>
And when the rain adown it streams<BR>
'Tis polished lead with pale-blue gleams.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
When the clouds vanish and the rain<BR>
Stops, and the sun comes out again,<BR>
It shimmers golden in the sun<BR>
Almost too bright to look upon.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But soon beneath the steady rays<BR>
The roof is dried and reft of blaze,<BR>
'Tis dusty yellow traversed through<BR>
By long thin lines of deepest blue.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then at the last, as night draws near,<BR>
The lines grow faint and disappear,<BR>
The roof becomes a purple mist,<BR>
A great square darkening amethyst<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Which sinks into the gathering shade<BR>
Till separate form and colour fade,<BR>
And it is but a patch which mars<BR>
The beauty of a field of stars.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
II<BR>
</H4>

<P CLASS="poem">
It stands so lonely in the sky<BR>
The sparrows never come thereby,<BR>
The glossy starlings seldom stop<BR>
To preen and chatter on the top.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For a whole week sometimes up there<BR>
No wing-wave stirs the quiet air,<BR>
The roof lies silent and serene<BR>
As though no life had ever been;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Till some bright afternoon, athwart<BR>
The edge two sudden shadows dart,<BR>
And two white pigeons with pink feet<BR>
Flutter above and pitch on it.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Jerking their necks out as they walk<BR>
They talk awhile their pigeon-talk,<BR>
A low continuous murmur blent<BR>
Of mock reproaches and content.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then cease, and sit there warm and white<BR>
An hour, till in the fading light<BR>
They wake, and know the close of day,<BR>
Flutter above, and fly away,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Leaving the roof whereon they sat<BR>
As 'twas before, a peaceful flat<BR>
Expanse, as silent and serene<BR>
As though no life had ever been.<BR>

TOWN<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Mostly in a dull rotation<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We bear our loads and eat and drink and sleep.<BR>
Feeling no tears, knowing no meditation&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too tired to think, too clogged with earth to weep.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Dimly convinced, poor groping wretches,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like eyeless insects in a murky pond<BR>
That out and out this city stretches,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away, away, and there is no beyond.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
No larger earth, no loftier heaven,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No cleaner, gentler airs to breathe.  And yet,<BR>
Even to us sometimes is given<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visions of things we other times forget.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Some day is done, its labour ended,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as we sit and brood at windows high,<BR>
A steady wind from far descended,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blows off the filth that hid the deeper sky;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There are the empty waiting spaces,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We watch, we watch, unwinking, pale and dumb,<BR>
Till gliding up with noiseless paces,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night covers all the wide arch: Night has come.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Not that sick false night of the city,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lurid and low and yellow and obscene,<BR>
But mother Night, pure, full of pity,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star-strewn Night, blue, potent and serene.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O, as we gaze the clamour ceases,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbid world around grows dim and small,<BR>
The soft-shed influence releases<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our shrouded spirits from their dusty pall.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
No more we hear the turbulent traffic,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not scorned but unremembered is the day;<BR>
The Night, all luminous and seraphic,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has brushed its heavy memories away.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The great blue Night so clear and kindly,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little stars so wide-eyed and so still,<BR>
Open a door for souls that blindly<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had wandered, tunnelling the endless hill;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
They draw the long-untraversed portal,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our souls slip out and tremble and expand,<BR>
The immortal feels for the immortal,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal holds the eternal by the hand.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Impalpably we are led and lifted,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly we shake into the gulf of blue,<BR>
The last environing veil is rifted<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lost horizons float into our view.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Lost lands, lone seas, lands that afar gleam<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a miraculous beauty, faint yet clear,<BR>
Forgotten lands of night and star-gleam,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seas that are somewhere but that are not here.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Borne without effort or endeavour,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swifter and more ethereal than the wind,<BR>
In level track we stream, whilst ever<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair pale panorama rolls behind.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now fleets below a trancèd moorland,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweep of glimmering immobility;<BR>
Now craggy cliff and dented foreland<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass back and there beyond unfolds the sea.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now wastes of water heaving, drawing,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great darkling tracts of patterned restlessness,<BR>
With whitened waves round rough rocks mawing<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And licking islands in their fierce caress.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now coasts with capes and ribboned beaches<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set silent 'neath the canopy sapphirine,<BR>
And estuaries and river reaches.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phantasmal silver in the night's soft shine.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Ah, these fair woods the spirit crosses,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These quiet lakes, these stretched dreaming fields,<BR>
These undulate downs with piny bosses<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointing the ridges of their sloping shields.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
These valleys and these heights that screen them,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tawnier sands where grass and tree are not,<BR>
Ah, we have known them, we have seen them,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw them long ago and we forgot;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
We know them all, these placid countries,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what the pathway is and what the goal;<BR>
These are the gates and these the sentries<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That guard that ancient fortress of the soul.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And we speed onward flying, flying,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the sundering waves of hill and plain<BR>
To where they rear their heads undying<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unnamed mountains of old days again.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The snows upon their calm still summits,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chasms, the files of trees that foot the snow,<BR>
Curving like inky frozen comets,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the forest-ocean spread below.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The glisten where the peaks are hoarest,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soundless darkness of the sunken vales,<BR>
The folding leagues of shadowy forest,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edge beyond edge till all distinctness fails.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So invulnerable it is, so deathless,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So floods the air the loveliness of it,<BR>
That we stay dazzled, rapt and breathless,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our beings ebbing to the infinite.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There as we pause, there as we hover,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still-poised in ecstasy, a sudden light<BR>
Breaks in our eyes, and we discover<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sit at windows gazing to the night.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Wistful and tired, with eyes a-tingle<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where still the sting of Beauty faintly smarts;<BR>
But with our mute regrets there mingle<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the resurrection of our hearts.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O night so great that will not mock us!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O stars so wise that understand the weak!<BR>
O vast consoling hands that rock us!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O strong and perfect tongues that speak!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O night enrobed in azure splendour!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O whispering stars whose radiance falls like dew!<BR>
O mighty presences and tender,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have given us back the dreams our childhood knew!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Lulled by your visions without number,<BR>
We seek our beds content and void of pain,<BR>
And dreaming drowse and dreaming slumber<BR>
And dreaming wake to see the day again.<BR>

When I was a boy there was a friend of mine:<BR>

We met again the other night<BR>
With people; you were quite polite,<BR>
Shook my hand and spoke a while<BR>
Of common things with cautious smile;<BR>
Paid the usual debt men owe<BR>
To fellows whom they used to know.<BR>
But, when our eyes met full, yours dropped,<BR>
And sudden, resolute, you stopped,<BR>
Moving with hurried syllables<BR>
To make remarks to someone else.<BR>
I caught them not, to me they said:<BR>
"Let the dead past bury its dead,<BR>
Things were very different then,<BR>
Boys are fools and men are men."<BR>
Several times the other night<BR>
You did your best to be polite;<BR>
When in the conversation's round<BR>
You heard my tongue's familiar sound<BR>
You bent in eager pose my way<BR>
To hear what I had got to say;<BR>
Trying, you thought with some success,<BR>
To hide the chasm's nakedness.<BR>
But on your eyes hard films there lay;<BR>
No mock-interest, no pretence<BR>
Could veil your blank indifference;<BR>
And if thoughts came recalling things<BR>
Far-off, far-off, from those old springs<BR>
When underneath the moon and sun<BR>
Our separate pulses beat as one,<BR>
Vagrant tender thoughts that asked<BR>
Admittance found the portal masked;<BR>
You spurned them; when I'd said my say,<BR>
With laugh and nod you turned away<BR>
To toss your friends some easy jest<BR>
That smote my brow and stabbed my breast.<BR>
Foolish though it be and vain<BR>
I am not master of my pain,<BR>
And when I said good-night to you<BR>
I hoped we should not meet again,<BR>
And wondered how the soul I knew<BR>
Could change so much; have I changed too?<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
As I stand waiting in the rain<BR>
For the foggy hoot of the London train,<BR>
Gazing at silent wall and lamp<BR>
And post and rail and platform damp,<BR>
What is this power that comes to my sight<BR>
That I see a night without the night,<BR>
That I see them clear, yet look them through,<BR>
The silvery things and the darkly blue,<BR>
That the solid wall seems soft as death,<BR>
A wavering and unanchored wraith,<BR>
And rails that shine and stones that stream<BR>
Unsubstantial as a dream?<BR>
What sudden door has opened so,<BR>
What hand has passed, that I should know<BR>
This moving vision not a trance<BR>
That melts the globe of circumstance,<BR>
This sight that marks not least or most<BR>
And makes a stone a passing ghost?<BR>
Is it that a year ago<BR>
I stood upon this self-same spot;<BR>
Is it that since a year ago<BR>
The place and I have altered not;<BR>
Is it that I half forgot,<BR>
A year ago, and all despised<BR>
For a space the things that I had prized:<BR>
The race of life, the glittering show?<BR>
Is it that now a year has passed<BR>
In vain pursuit of glittering things,<BR>
In fruitless searching, shouting, running,<BR>
And greedy lies and candour cunning,<BR>
Here as I stand the year above<BR>
Sudden the heats and the strivings fail<BR>
And fall away, a fluctuant veil,<BR>
And the fixed familiar stones restore<BR>
The old appearance-buried core,<BR>
The unmoving and essential me,<BR>
The eternal personality<BR>
Alone enduring first and last?<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
No, this I have known in other ways,<BR>
In other places, other days.<BR>

Of the transparency of form,<BR>
The bootless stress of minds that range,<BR>
The awful calm behind the storm.<BR>
In many places, many days,<BR>
The invaded soul receives the rays<BR>
Of countries she was nurtured in,<BR>
Speaks in her silent language strange<BR>
To that beyond which is her kin.<BR>
Even in peopled streets at times<BR>
A metaphysic arm is thrust<BR>
Through the partitioning fabric thin,<BR>
And tears away the darkening pall<BR>
Cast by the bright phenomenal,<BR>
And clears the obscurèd spirit's mirror<BR>
From shadows of deceptive error,<BR>
And shows the bells and all their ringing,<BR>
And all the crowds and all their singing,<BR>
Carillons that are nothing's chimes<BR>

Take I draughts and drink them up<BR>
Poured from many a stalk and cup.<BR>
Now do I burn for nothing more<BR>
Than thus to gaze, thus to adore<BR>
This exquisiteness of nature ever<BR>
In silence....<BR>

Doomed barks on an eternal sea,<BR>
Flit phantom-like as transient smoke.<BR>

Her message told, may not endure;<BR>
Her portal opened, she has died,<BR>
Supreme immortal suicide.<BR>

To the primal end of her journeyings,<BR>
Her ultimate and constant pole.<BR>

Even a critic's more than clay<BR>

For you a tree would never be<BR>
Lovely were it but a tree,<BR>

Your eyes are on a farther shore<BR>

Some prophet with a voice of thunder<BR>

Or blaze upon a paper screen<BR>
The evidence of things not seen?<BR>
This art of ours but grows and stirs<BR>
Experience when it registers,<BR>
And you know well as I know well<BR>
This autumn of time in which we dwell<BR>
Is not an age of revelations<BR>
Solid as once, but intimations<BR>
That touch us with warm misty fingers<BR>
Leaving a nameless sense that lingers<BR>
That sight is blind and Time's a snare<BR>
And earth less solid than the air<BR>
And deep below all seeming things<BR>
There sits a steady king of kings<BR>
A radiant ageless permanence,<BR>
A quenchless fount of virtue whence<BR>
We draw our life; a sense that makes<BR>
A staunch conviction nothing shakes<BR>
Of our own immortality.<BR>

I see through pupils of the beast<BR>
Though it be faint and blurred with mist<BR>
A Star that travels in the East.<BR>
I see what I can, not what I will.<BR>
In things that move, things that are still;<BR>
Thin motion, even cloudier rest,<BR>
I see the symbols God hath drest.<BR>
The moveless trees, the trees that wave<BR>
The clouds that heavenly highways have,<BR>
Horses that run, rocks that are fixt,<BR>
Streams that have rest and motion mixt,<BR>
The main with its abiding flux,<BR>
The wind that up my chimney sucks<BR>
A mounting waterfall of flame,<BR>
Sticks, straws, dust, beetles and that same<BR>
Old blazing sun the Psalmist saw<BR>
A testifier to the law:<BR>
Divinely to the heart they speak<BR>
Saying how they are but weak,<BR>
Wan will-o'-the-wisps on the crystal sea;<BR>

Manchurian peasants sweltered in their fields,<BR>
And Greeks drove carts to Patras, and lone men<BR>
Saw burning summer come and go again<BR>
And huddled from the winds of winter on<BR>
The fertile deserts of Saskatchewan.<BR>
To fabricate these things have been marchings and slaughters,<BR>
The sun has toiled and the moon has moved the waters,<BR>
Cities have laboured, and crowded plains, and deep in the earth<BR>
Men have plunged unafraid with ardour to wrench the worth<BR>
Of sweating dim-lit caverns, and paths have been hewn<BR>
Through forests where for uncounted years nor sun nor moon<BR>
Have penetrated, men have driven straight shining rails<BR>
Through the dense bowels of mountains, and climbed their frozen tops,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wrinkled sailors have shouted at shouting gales<BR>
In the huge Pacific, and battled around the Horn<BR>
And gasping, coasted to Rio, and turning towards the morn,<BR>
Fought over the wastes to Spain, and battered and worn,<BR>
Sailed up the Channel, and on into the Nore<BR>
To the city of masts and the smoky familiar shore.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For months you have lain<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a graveyard's green<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some place abroad where I've never been.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps there is a stone over you,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or only the wood and the earth and the grass cover you.<BR>
But it doesn't much matter; for dead and decayed you lie<BR>
Like a million million others who felt they would never die,<BR>
Like Alexander and Helen the beautiful,<BR>
And the last collier hanged for murdering his trull;<BR>
All done with and buried in an equal bed.<BR>

Yes, you are dead like all the other dead.<BR>
You are not here, but I am here alone.<BR>
And evening falls, fusing tree, water and stone<BR>
Into a violet cloth, and the frail ash-tree hisses<BR>
With a soft sharpness like a fall of mounded grain.<BR>
And a steamer softly puffing along the river passes,<BR>
Drawing a file of barges; and silence falls again.<BR>
And a bell tones; and the evening darkens; and in sparse rank<BR>
The greenish lights well out along the other bank.<BR>
I have no force left now; the sights and sounds impinge<BR>
Upon me unresisted, like raindrops on the mould.<BR>
And, striving not against my melancholy mood,<BR>
Limp as a door that hangs upon one failing hinge,<BR>
Limp, with slack marrowless arms and thighs, I sit and brood<BR>
On death and death and death.  And quiet, thin and cold,<BR>
Following of this one friend the hopeless, helpless ghost,<BR>
The weak appealing wraiths of notable men of old<BR>
Who died, pass through the air; and then, host after host,<BR>
Innumerable, overwhelming, without form,<BR>
Rolling across the sky in awful silent storm,<BR>
The myriads of the undifferentiated dead<BR>
Whom none recorded, or of whom the record faded.<BR>
O spectacle appallingly sublime!<BR>
I see the universe one long disastrous strife,<BR>
And in the staggering abysses of backward and forward time<BR>
Death chasing hard upon the heels of creating life.<BR>
And I, I see myself as one of a heap of stones<BR>
Wetted a moment to life as the flying wave goes over,<BR>
Onward and never returning, leaving no mark behind.<BR>
There's nothing to hope for.  Blank cessation numbs my mind,<BR>
And I feel my heart thumping gloomy against its cover,<BR>
My heavy belly hanging from my bones.<BR>

And the leaves are never stirred by the panther's velvet sheen.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
It blooms once a year in summer moonlight,<BR>
In a valley of dark fear full of pale moonlight:<BR>
It blooms once a year, and dies in a night,<BR>
And its petals disappear with the dawn's first light;<BR>
And when that night has come, black small-breasted maids,<BR>
With ecstatic terror dumb, steal fawn-like through the shades<BR>
To watch, hour by hour, the unfolding of the flower.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
When the world is full of night, and the moon reigns alone<BR>
And drowns in silver light the known and the unknown,<BR>
When each hut is a mound, half blue silver and half black,<BR>
And casts upon the ground the hard shadow of its back,<BR>
When the winds are out of hearing and the tree-tops never shake,<BR>
When the grass in the clearing is silent but awake<BR>
'Neath a moon-paven sky: all the village is asleep<BR>
And the babes that nightly cry dream deep:<BR>

Tiptoe over dreaming curs, soft, so soft, that not one stirs,<BR>
And stand curved and a-quiver, like bathers by a river,<BR>
Looking at the forest wall, groups of slender naked girls,<BR>
Whose black bodies shine like pearls where the moonbeams fall.<BR>
They have waked, they knew not why, at a summons from the night,<BR>
They have stolen fearfully from the dark to the light,<BR>
Stepping over sleeping men, who have moved and slept again:<BR>
And they know not why they go to the forest, but they know,<BR>
As their moth-feet pass to the shore of the grass<BR>
And the forest's dreadful brink, that their tender spirits shrink:<BR>
They would flee, but cannot turn, for their eyelids burn<BR>
With frenzy, and each maid, ere she leaves the moonlit space,<BR>
If she sees another's face is thrilled and afraid.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now like little phantom fawns they thread the outer lawns<BR>
Where the boles of giant trees stand about in twos and threes,<BR>
Till the forest grows more dense and the darkness more intense,<BR>
And they only sometimes see in a lone moon-ray<BR>
A dead and spongy trunk in the earth half-sunk,<BR>
Or the roots of a tree with fungus grey,<BR>
Or a drift of muddy leaves, or a banded snake that heaves.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
And the towering unseen roof grows more intricate, and soon<BR>
It is featureless and proof to the lost forgotten moon.<BR>
But they could not look above as with blind-drawn feet they move<BR>
Onwards on the scarce-felt path, with quick and desperate breath,<BR>
For their circling fingers dread to caress some slimy head,<BR>
Or to touch the icy shape of a hunched and hairy ape,<BR>
And at every step they fear in their very midst to hear<BR>
A lion's rending roar or a tiger's snore....<BR>
And when things swish or fall, they shiver but dare not call.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
O what is it leads the way that they do not stray?<BR>
What unimagined arm keeps their bodies from harm?<BR>
What presence concealed lifts their little feet that yield<BR>
Over dry ground and wet till their straining eyes are met<BR>
With a thinning of the darkness?<BR>
And the foremost faintly cries in awed surprise:<BR>
And they one by one emerge from the gloom to the verge<BR>
Of a small sunken vale full of moonlight pale.<BR>
And they hang along the bank, clinging to the branches dank,<BR>
A shadowy festoon out of sight of the moon;<BR>
And they see in front of them, rising from the mud<BR>
A single straight stem and a single pallid bud<BR>
In that little lake of light from the moon's calm height.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
A stem, a ghostly bud, on the moon-swept mud<BR>

Shake and arouse hissing leaves on the boughs.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
And they whisper aswoon: Did it move in the moon?<BR>
O it moved as it grew!<BR>
It is moving, opening, with calm and gradual will,<BR>
And their bodies where they cling are shadowed and still<BR>
And with marvel they mark that the mud now is dark<BR>
For the unfolding flower, like a goddess in her power,<BR>
Challenges the moon with a light of her own,<BR>
That lovelily grows as the petals unclose,<BR>
Wider, more wide with an awful inward pride,<BR>
Till the heart of it breaks, and stilled is their breath,<BR>
For the radiance it makes is as wonderful as death.<BR>

Longer than her wont stays shut in the dimness of her hut,<BR>
For she feels a brooding cloud of memory in the air,<BR>
A lingering thing there that makes her sit bowed<BR>
With hollow shining eyes, as the night-fire dies,<BR>
And stare softly at the ember, and try to remember<BR>
Something sorrowful and far, something sweet and vaguely seen<BR>
Like an early evening star when the sky is pale green:<BR>
A quiet silver tower that climbed in an hour,<BR>
Or a ghost like a flower, or a flower like a queen:<BR>
Something holy in the past that came and did not last.<BR>

I am a lake, altered by every wind.<BR>
The mild South breathes upon me, and I spread<BR>
A dance of merry ripples in the sun.<BR>

Under the East wind bitter I grow and chill,<BR>
Slate-coloured, desolate, hopeless.  But when blows<BR>
A steady wind from the North my motion ceases,<BR>
I am frozen smooth and hard; my conquered surface<BR>
Returns the skies' cold light without a comment.<BR>

One would not know were it not for the moon in the sky,<BR>

Falling and dying, falling and dying.<BR>

There is my lost Abana,<BR>
And there is my nameless Pharphar<BR>
That mixed with my heart when I was a boy,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And time stood still.<BR>

And I say I will go there and die there:<BR>
But I do not go there, and sometimes<BR>
I think that the train could not carry me there,<BR>

That it's farther than Asia or Africa,<BR>
Or any voyager's harbour,<BR>
Farther, farther, beyond recall....<BR>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
